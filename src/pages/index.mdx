# Jason Long

I am a **product designerd** currently working at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com). Before that, I worked at [GitHub](https://github.com) for 9 years. [[View my read.cv profile](https://read.cv/jasonlong)]

## Projects

I've created a few logos for open source projects like [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

These are a few of the open source projects I've worked on: [[View my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jasonlong)]

## About

I live in Columbus, Ohio and I'm married with three children. One is out of college, one's in college, and the other is 7 years old. I have a degree in Computer Science from Ohio State and I started my career as a Windows developer. I worked with PHP, ASP, and Java before getting into Rails while freelancing in the early 00's. During this time, my interests shifted towards design.

## Tools

* My hardware setup consists of an M1 MacBook Pro, XDR display, and a QK65 keyboard by Qwertykeys. [[Some outdated photos of my workspace](https://www.workspaces.xyz/p/160-jason-long)]
* My dev environment is Neovim + tmux with the Nord theme. [[View dotfiles](https://github.com/jasonlong/dotfiles)]

## Current enjoying
* [Kagi](https://kagi.com). Paying for a search engine sounds ridiculous, but I finally tried it and quickly paid up. Highly recommended.
* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/). The best AI "research assistant" I've tried. Pro plans can utilize GPT-4 and Claude 2. 
* [Doom Guy](https://romero.com/shop/p/doomguy). New book by id Software co-founder John Romero.
* [Reflect](https://reflect.app). I like the simplicity of this notes app rather than the complexity of Roam or Obsidian.
* [Stops](https://eff.co/stops). iOS camera app that's dead simple and creates beautiful, filmic images.
* [P3 colors with OKLCH](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl). We're able to progressively enhance our CSS colors today and this post is a great starting point.
* [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/). Nice lightweight Rust-based terminal that uses a Lua config file.
