# Jason Long

I am a **product designerd** currently working at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com). Before that, I worked at [GitHub](https://github.com) for 9 years. [[View my read.cv profile](https://read.cv/jasonlong)]

## Projects

I've created a few logos for open source projects like [Git](https://git-scm.com), [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

These are a few of the open source projects I've worked on: [[View my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jasonlong)]

## About

I live in Columbus, Ohio and I'm married with three children. One is out of college, one's in college, and the other is 7 years old. I have a degree in Computer Science from Ohio State and I started my career as a Windows developer. I worked with PHP, ASP, and Java before getting into Rails while freelancing in the early 00's. During this time, my interests shifted towards design.

## Tools

* My hardware setup consists of an M1 MacBook Pro, XDR display, and a Tofu65 keyboard by KBDfans. [[View photos of my workspace](https://www.workspaces.xyz/p/160-jason-long)]
* My dev environment is Neovim + tmux with a modified Nord theme. [[View dotfiles](https://github.com/jasonlong/dotfiles)]

## Current enjoying

* [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/). Nice lightweight Rust-based terminal that uses a Lua config file. 
* [LazyVim](https://astro.build/). I used to be very against pre-packaged Vim distributions, but the complexity of managing LSP servers, plugins, and keymaps makes them worth it now.
* [Astro](https://astro.build/). Creating this simple site was my first experience with it and I'm impressed with the concept, docs, and DX.
* [StepsApp](https://steps.app). I try to walk 8-10k steps a day and use this for tracking.
* [Copilot](https://copilot.money) for tracking finances. Not to be confused with GitHub's Copilot (which is also great).
* [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) Mastodon client for iOS and Mac. Twitter killing 3rd party clients was the final straw for me and Ivory feels like home for this long-time Tweetbot user.
