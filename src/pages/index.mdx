# Jason Long

I am a product designer working at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com). Before that, I worked at [GitHub](https://github.com) for 9 years and before that I freelanced for quite a while.

## Projects

I've created a few logos for open source projects like [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

These are a few of the open source projects I've worked on: [[My GitHub profile](https://github.com/jasonlong)]

## About

I live in Columbus, Ohio and I'm married with three children. Two are out of college and the other is 9 years old. I have a degree in Computer Science from Ohio State and I started my career as a Windows developer. I worked with PHP, ASP, and Java before getting into Rails while freelancing in the early 00's. During this time, my interests shifted towards design.

## Tools

- My hardware setup consists of an M4 MacBook Pro, XDR display, and a QK65 keyboard by Qwertykeys. [[Some outdated photos of my workspace](https://www.workspaces.xyz/p/160-jason-long)]
- My dev environment is Neovim + tmux with a custom Poimandres theme. [[Dotfiles](https://github.com/jasonlong/dotfiles)]

## Current enjoying

- [Rollerblade Twister XT](https://www.rollerblade.com/usa/en/men/performance/freeskate/twister-xt). I used to skate in the mid-90s and have picked it back up as a safe (or is it not safe?) midlife crisis hobby. I've swapped out the frame for an [Endless 90](https://www.endlessblading.com/products/endless-90-mk2-frame) and I'm using a 4x90mm setup.
- [Switch 2](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/). My prime gaming years are long behind me, but I love Mario Kart and I'm discovering Cyberpunk 2077, Hades, and Dead Cells.
- [Zerocam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zerocam-anti-ai-camera/id6483933438). Amazing iPhone camera app that is dirt simple and produces colors that are :chefs-kiss:.
- [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/home). Another good site full of inspiring photos and design. It's not as deep as Are.na, but it has a great UX.
- [Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty). New terminal emulator by Mitchell Hashimoto. He posts occassional development logs on his site and is active on the project's Discord server.
- [REZZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmUq1eWlOu4). Some EDM music is too much for me, but I like her dark, heavy sound. This Brooklyn Mirage set is so good.
- [Are.na](https://are.na/jason-long-wwkm0r1awty/channels). An endless rabbit hole of inspiring, strange, and interesting things.
